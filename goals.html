            <h2>1. Travel the world together</h2>
            <p class="goal-description">I pray that we will be able to travel the world together, to visit as many places and to make as many memories together as possible. I pray that God would use us anywhere we would go and that we could serve the Lord even in our visits.</p>

            <p class="goal-description">No matter where we will live and no matter what kind of house we will have, it will always be my home as long as you are with me. I can't wait to build a whole future with you and have our own place to call home. A place where we can return to at the end of the day and enjoy it together.</p>

            <p class="goal-description">The only thing that would make our house feel even more like a home will be when we bring our children to this world. When we will have 3 beautiful children that look like you and have your smile and your kind soul and character. We will teach them all about Jesus and will have a beautiful, blessed family. I already pray for our future children, and I know that you do too. Having a family with you is like my ultimate goal.</p>

I pray that God will use us for his glory in as many ways as possible and that He will provide for us in everything. I pray that He will look with favor on us and that we will be together in heaven with Him and with our whole family (both mine and yours). I pray that people will come to God through us and that all the glory will be given to Him.</p>
