            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>This is us—two people who somehow turned chaos into a relationship. I’m the one who starts every conversation with ‘I’m not complaining', only to complain for 10 minutes straight, while he’s the laid-back ‘everything’s fine’ guy who somehow doesn’t mind my random outbursts. Well, hopefully anyway.  Together, we make an art form out of chaos, sarcasm, and spontaneous plans.</p>

                <h3>Princess Alessia</h3>
                <p>This is me, self-proclaimed expert in overthinking every little thing (just like my boyfriend from this point of view). I have more personalities than I know what to do with, one minute I’m all calm and collected, the next I’m an emotional rollercoaster. My boyfriend enjoys it tho. He better do. I’m also a connoisseur of sarcasm and have a PhD in giving my boyfriend just the right amount of attitude.  I'm equal parts sass, sweetness, and everything in between—because life’s too short to take seriously.</p>

                <h3>Boyfriend AJ </h3>
                <p>This is my boyfriend, the walking definition of ‘too good to be true.’ He’s the kind of guy who always knows how to make me laugh, even when I’m trying to be mad at him. He has a sixth sense for knowing when I need a hug, even if I didn’t ask for one. He’s the best at finding the silver lining, especially when the WiFi goes down or when his favorite snack is out of stock. If being caring, funny, and impossibly charming were an Olympic sport, he’d have more gold than Michael Phelps. (idk who that is, I just looked it up lol)</p>

            <h2>Our Journey</h2>
            <p>Our story began in the most unexpected yet magical way—at a winter camp. We only talked for a few minutes, just enough to leave an impression that lingered. Time passed, but something about him stayed with me. Then, on my birthday, he messaged me—reserved, unsure, but sweet. And somehow, that was all it took. I liked him from that very moment.

                What started as a quiet spark slowly grew into something truly special. This winter, everything came full circle. He came to Romania, and those days together felt like a dream. We went ice skating, laughing and slipping hand-in-hand, explored beautiful places blanketed in snow, and shared warm, meaningful moments. He met my parents too—it felt like everything was falling into place.
                
                It’s crazy to think how a short conversation at camp turned into the most beautiful and meaningful relationship I've ever had. AJ became my everything and I would have never guessed it if you have told me about it a little over a year ago. But it is truly the best thing ever.</p>
