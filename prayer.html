        <h1>My prayer</h1>
        <p>Dear Lord,</p>
        <p>Thank You for blessing us with love, understanding, and a beautiful journey together. We are grateful for every moment we share, every challenge we overcome, and every joy we experience in Your presence.</p>
        <p>Lord, guide us as we grow as a couple. Strengthen our love, help us support each other, and keep You at the center of our relationship. May we always be patient, kind, and faithful to one another.</p>
        <p>We pray for wisdom in our decisions, courage in our struggles, and gratitude in our successes. Let our love be a reflection of Your grace, and may we always find joy in the journey You have set before us.</p>
        <p>Thank You, Lord, for this beautiful gift of love.</p>
        <p>Father, I pray for AJ, who is the most beautiful gift I have ever received from Youâ€”for peace, for protection, and for the fullness of Your presence in his life. I pray that You continue to bless him with holy wisdom, the kind that sees beyond the surface and walks in the light of truth. Clothe him in courage, Lordâ€”a courage rooted not in pride but in Your eternal strength. May his confidence be built not on fleeting things, but on the unshakable foundation of Your calling, Your promises, and Your love.</p> 

        <p>   Thank You, Father, for all that You have done and continue to do in and through him. Thank You for the quiet ways You've shaped his heart, for the moments of growth, even through struggle, and for the joy that radiates from his spirit. You have formed in him a soul that reflects Your gentleness, a mind capable of deep thought and understanding, and a heart that chooses kindness when the world pushes toward hardness.</p> 
            
        <p>   I ask that You guard his mind from fear, his heart from discouragement, and his spirit from weariness. Fill him, Lord, with divine clarityâ€”so that he may discern Your voice above the noise, and walk boldly in the path You've carved out for him. Let his life be a testament of Your faithfulness. May he never feel alone, for You go before him, beside him, and within him. </p> 
            
        <p>   I pray, too, that You would continue to knit our souls together in Your perfect timing and willâ€”that we may encourage each other, grow together, and reflect Your love more fully. Bless the love we share with purity, depth, and purpose, and let it be a reflection of Christâ€™s love for the Churchâ€”selfless, enduring, and true. </p> 
           
            
        <p>    In all things, Father, be glorified through him. Continue shaping AJ into the man You created him to beâ€”bold and humble, wise and kind, joyful and steadfast. Let Your peace rule in his heart like a river that cannot be stopped, and may Your presence be the home where he finds rest.</p>
        <p>Thank You, Lord, for this beautiful gift of love.</p>
